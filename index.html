A right approach ensures that entitlements are available to all children without any discrimination. Pankh works for children living in villages, orphanages, street shelters and school dropouts as they have a severe deficiency of role models to look up to.</p>
                    <p>Our program will be providing a set of children with volunteers who would provide them with mentoring and  support in subjects such as Maths, Science and English following the school curriculum of the children. Empowering children to make informed decisions by providing a support system that enables career awareness, skill building and self awareness through experience-based learning.</p>

Even though India's children account for more than one-third of its population, their interests have never been given priority. And their rights have been violated every single day.The statistics are grim. What is worse is that very little is known of what it means to be part of such horrific numbers. The task before us is huge and we believe that for real change to happen, every member of our society should take responsibility to change the lives of these children permanently. While the reality in India may be far from ideal, we at Pankh believe that every child has a right to dream.</p>

                            It most certainly does. A small amount goes a long way. It is these seemingly small contributions that collectively add up to a large amount needed to effect change. There are people all over who are concerned about the situation of children and who want to do something to change it. However, their own commitments and pressures do not allow them to go out and directly work with children. Pankh  provides them the opportunity to help in whatever way they can. They can contribute their money, materials, time, or skills. When everybody comes together and pitches in, no task is impossible. This COLLECTIVE ACTION has an impact and brings about change. Every individual’s contribution is important. This is the fundamental principle on which Pankh functions.

                          Why does volunteering as a teacher with Pankh require six months commitment?

                        Unfortunately, Pankh is not a short-term engagement. Teachers are expected to commit for the duration of six month. Why? Because the children we teach have been abandoned several times in their lives. And we can't have teachers walk in and out, every other weekend. A constant and steady relationship is needed to cultivate that bond with them. At Pankh teachers don't just teach, they also serve as role models for these children. I hope you're able to understand the reasoning behind this request.Do register on our website as and when you have settled down. We'd love to have you around!

                        As a pair, mentor and mentee work through a curriculum designed and structured by the Mentortogether team. Mentors work on improving mentees’ language skills, developing mentees’ life skills, and helping them pursue their academic and career goals. As a non – parental adult, mentors are not perceived as authority figures, thereby creating a positive environment for youth to be themselves and grow into strong adults.
